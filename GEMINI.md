# Workspace Instructions

## Lockfiles, Commits, Tags, And Releases
- Do not leave completed work uncommitted. After each coherent, validated change set, create a commit and push it in the same session.
- Use multiple commits and pushes when that keeps unrelated changes, partial validations, or follow-up fixes clearly separated. Prefer small, logically grouped commits over one mixed commit.
- This repo is asset-only and does not use a package-manager lockfile. Keep `.gitattributes` and Git LFS tracking rules correct when adding, replacing, or migrating large assets.
- Use lowercase annotated semver tags only. Do not invent ad-hoc labels such as `V1`, `torca-r07`, `pre-lfs-migration-*`, or similar one-off names.
- This repo follows the stable `v1.x` line. Stay on `v1` for routine work; only cut `v2` for an intentional breaking asset-delivery or repository-structure change.
- Create an annotated tag when a curated asset set, public delivery structure, or LFS policy change is ready for downstream use.
- Create a GitHub release when that tag represents a named asset snapshot or delivery milestone that other repos or operators should consume. Release notes should summarize scope, validation, rollout notes, and any migration or recovery steps.
- If the existing tag or release history contains stale drafts, redundant entries, or ad-hoc labels, clean that history up instead of preserving clutter.
- Skip tags and releases for trivial doc-only edits, formatting-only changes, or routine housekeeping unless they change deployment, operations, or a consumer-facing contract.
- Do not publish releases for one-off asset drops or housekeeping unless they are part of a deliberate shipped snapshot.
